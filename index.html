        <h1>How do we help farmers</h1>
        <p> organic farming offers farmers not only 
            economic benefits but also opportunities
             to promote environmental sustainability, 
             improve soil health, and contribute to healthier 
             food systems.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="Highlights-col">
                <h3>"Higher Profits"</h3>
                <p> Organic produce often commands premium prices in the market
                     due to consumer demand for healthier and sustainably 
                     produced food. This can lead to increased profitability for 
                     farmers, offsetting potential higher production costs 
                     associated with organic farming practices.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="Highlights-col">
                <h3>"Improved Soil Health"</h3>
                <p> Organic farming methods focus on enhancing soil fertility
                     and structure through practices like crop rotation, cover 
                     cropping, and organic amendments like compost. Healthy soil 
                     not only supports better crop yields but also reduces the 
                     need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, saving costs
                      in the long run.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="Highlights-col">
                <h3>"Environmental Sustainability"</h3>
                <p> Organic farming promotes environmentally friendly 
                    practices such as reduced chemical inputs, conservation 
                    of water and biodiversity, and the use of renewable 
                    resources. By adopting organic methods, farmers contribute 
                    to long-term environmental sustainability and resilience 
                    against climate change impacts.
